Before joining Zhejiang University, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, working with &lt;a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/home">Prof. Michael R. Lyu&lt;/a>. I obtained my Ph.D degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University, where I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of &lt;a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/sunjl">Prof. Jianling Sun&lt;/a>. During my PhD period, I also had an unforgettable visiting experience at the Australian National University under the supervision of &lt;a href="https://cecc.anu.edu.au/people/zhenchang-xing">Prof. Zhenchang Xing&lt;/a>. My research interests include Software Engineering, Knowledge Graph and Blockchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I am currently recruiting Masters and PhD students for the September 2026 intake, focusing on the application of artificial intelligence in software engineering (AI4SE). Interested candidates who are keen on academic research please contact me via email.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
